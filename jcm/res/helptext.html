		<h1>art1secs<br>counter machine</h1>
		<p>This is a simple implementation of a
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_machine">counter machine</a>
			inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDR_paper_computer">
			paper computer</a> introduced by german television in 1983.

			<table border="1">
				<tr>
					<th>Command</th>
					<th>Function</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>+&nbsp;X</td>
					<td>increments the value of register X by 1</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>-&nbsp;X</td>
					<td>decrements the value of register X by 1</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>0&nbsp;X</td>
					<td>checks if the value of register X is zero.
						if true, move pointer two steps forward,
						else move the pointer only one step forward.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>J&nbsp;Y</td>
					<td>moves the pointer to memory address Y</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Stop</td>
					<td>terminates the execution of the program. this
						is the only command that doesn't need an
						argument (register or address).
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

		<p>
			<b>NB</b>: please note that you have to enter <i>exactly</i>
			one command character (+, -, 0, J), a single empty space and
			an argument (a register (A-Z) or a memory address(1-20)). only
			the stop command doesn't need an argument. you can abreviate
			"Stop" with "S".
